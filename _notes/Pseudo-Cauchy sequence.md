An ordinal-indexed sequence $(a_\rho)_{\rho < \lambda}$ of elements of a [[Valued field]] $(K,v)$ is called *pseudo-Cauchy* if there exists $\bar\rho < \lambda$ such that, for every $\rho_2 > \rho_1 > \rho_0 \geq \bar\rho$,
$$v(a_{\rho_2}-a_{\rho_1}) > v(a_{\rho_1}-a_{\rho_0}).$$
In this case, for every $\rho_1 > \rho_0 \geq \bar\rho$ we have that
$$v(a_{\rho_1}-a_{\rho_0})$$
does not depend on $\rho_1$, and hence we denote by $\gamma_{\rho_0}$.
